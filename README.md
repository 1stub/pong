# pong
pong clone written in c++ sfml

What I would do differently: This was my first real game that I created in c++ sfml and didn't just follow a YouTube tutorial. I found that my code was super sloppy and hard to read. The main focus that I plan on having for my next project is to write code that is more concise and easier to read. Also to focus on some of the better conventions for sfml, like sprite.move(). I also plan on creating a game class for handling all of the game logic instead of doing it in the main file. Using global variables instead of magic numbers would be a much better idea also. 

TODO:
- [x] increase ball speed on return
- [x] main menu
- [x] add simple sounds
- [x] reset paddles after point scored
- [ ] (slightly)increase speed of paddles as they move
- [x] Allow for menu items to be traversed
- [ ] create variable for modifying ball speed
